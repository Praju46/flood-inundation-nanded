# Flood Inundation Mapping using 2D Rain-on-Grid Model  
(Nanded District, Maharashtra, India)

This repository contains workflows and analysis for flood inundation
mapping in **Nanded district** using a **2D Rain-on-Grid (RoG) hydrodynamic
modelling approach** integrated with geospatial data.

The study evaluates flood inundation dynamics over a **long-term period
from 1985 to 2025**, enabling assessment of temporal variability and
changing flood patterns under varying rainfall conditions.

## Project Overview

Flooding is a recurring hazard in parts of the Godavari River basin,
including Nanded district, due to intense monsoonal rainfall,
flat floodplains, and limited drainage capacity.

Unlike traditional river-centric flood modelling, the **Rain-on-Grid (RoG)**
approach directly applies rainfall over a gridded terrain surface,
allowing simulation of overland flow, flow accumulation, and inundation
patterns across the landscape.

## Objectives

- Simulate surface runoff and flood inundation using a 2D Rain-on-Grid model.
- Delineate spatial extent of flood-prone areas over the period **1985–2025**.
- Analyze temporal variability in flood inundation patterns.
- Generate flood extent and depth information to support risk assessment
  and planning.

## Study Area

- **Nanded District**, Maharashtra, India  
- Part of the **Godavari River basin**
- Characterized by low-gradient floodplains, agricultural land use,
  and monsoon-driven hydrology.

## Methodology

1. Preparation of high-resolution Digital Elevation Model (DEM).
2. Derivation of terrain parameters (slope, flow direction, flow accumulation).
3. Integration of long-term rainfall data (**1985–2025**) as model input.
4. Application of rainfall inputs over the grid using the
   **2D Rain-on-Grid hydrodynamic model**.
5. Simulation of surface runoff, flow routing, and inundation extent.
6. Generation of flood depth and inundation maps.
7. Post-processing and spatial analysis of multi-decadal flood outputs.
